# Pythonistic

Pythonistic is python development stack that leverages Docker to create a highly portable development environment that just works. Creating and maintaining the exact same development environment across multiple machines and accounts was impeding my learning Python. Having watched [Jessie Frazelle's Container Hacks and Fun Images](http://example.com/ "Container Hacks and Fun Images") on containerizing desktop applications, it makes perfect sense to development environments as portable containers instead of trying perfectly replicate a native host environment on different machines. Pythonistic is my first attempt at creating and maintaining such an environment.
