# With Pythonista

Pythonista is python development stack that leverages Docker to create a highly portable development environment that just works. Creating and maintaining the exact same development environment across to machines and multiple accounts was a headache I begin learning python. Having watched Jessie Frazelle's Dockercon15 talk on containerizing desktop apps it made perfect sense to run my development environments as container instead of setting up a native host environment.
